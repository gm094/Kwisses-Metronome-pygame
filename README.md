Based on Kwiss's metronome. Exactly the same other than winsound being replaced by pygame. See original docs below

pygame and tkinter are required for this to run

# Metronome

Metronome v.1.0.0 (Python 3.5)

Metronome is a desktop metronome for Windows written in Python with Tkinter.

If you need a metronome on your desktop, this app is for you!

Check the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/Kwistech/Metronome/wiki) for more info.

## Installation ##

+ Fork the repository and clone it to your local drive.

+ From the program's root directory, double-click `main.py`

## How to Use

The below image is the GUI for Metronome:

Simply put, the user enters the Beats-Per-Minute (BPM) in the upper left entry box, sets the time signature (Time) with the spinbox in the upper right corner, then presses start/stop buttons as required.

## Features

Simple time signatures (4/4, 3/4, 2/2); compound time signature (6/8).

If there is vested interest in double time signatures, I will consider adding it as well.

Any suggestions and/or recommendations are welcome.
Feel free to try this app out for yourself!
